This is the Deck Designer Tool project. It works as a pane to control four main dimensions of layout design such as tagging, creating text styles, saving colors and positions. This functions automate the design process just as any other common design program would do. You can create tags to identify objects, then you can create text styles, color combinations and save commonly used positions. The tagging allows the tools to mass apply saved styles, colors and positions. So instead of designing slide by slide, you can work on multiple slides at the same time.

Currently this tools is meant to be used within the DJE Studio Hub - Colombia
